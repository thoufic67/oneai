Techstack
Always use the following
- HeroUI components
- Tailwindcss for css
- NextJs
- Framer motion for animation
- Lucide for any icons

Important: 
* Never try to use a different component library
* Don't use the older next ui components always use heroui
* Whenever you are creating new file add a file comment describing what the file does, whenever file changes update the description of the file


Feel free to use the playwright tool to open in browser for testing after making the file changes
