Techstack
Always use the following
- HeroUI components
- Tailwindcss for css
- NextJs
- Framer motion for animation
- Lucide for any icons
- Follow next app 

Important: 
* Never try to use a different component library
* Don't use the older next ui components always use heroui components
* Whenever you are creating new file add a file comment describing what the file does, whenever file changes update the description of the file
* Always use the createClient from `"@/lib/supabase/server";` for supabase client in api routes
* Ensure you are cleaning up any screenshot taken
* Always whenever creating types that will be used in multiple files create them in types/ folder and reuse, if it's only used locally then create it within the file


localhost url: http://localhost:3001/



While reading params in server components or in api paths follow the below example
```
export default function Page({
  params,
  searchParams,
}: {
  params: Promise<{ slug: string }>
  searchParams: Promise<{ [key: string]: string | string[] | undefined }>
}) {
  return <h1>My Page</h1>
}
```


Feel free to use the playwright tool to open in browser for testing after making the file changes
